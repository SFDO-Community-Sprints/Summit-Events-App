# Summit Events App

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:**
*On 1/29/2020 UST Events application was refactored to Summit Events App. This means all classes, objects, visualfoce pages, and text have been refactored to reflect the new name. Previous installed version of the application will need to be reinstalled to proceed with this update. This is a turning point in the project and it is our intention that this be the last of drastic architecture changes that is made.*

The Summit Events App is a sustainable open source community events app that serves a broad variety of needs for EDUs and NGOs. The event solution has the flexibility needed to offer events of different types: paid, free, group, guests, and individual. The solution will include the full life cycle of the event: registration, receipting, confirmation, reporting and web faced exposure. This solution facilitates a Salesforce connected campus and will be compatible with Salesforce.orgâ€™s Data Architectures.

## Legacy documentation

The [University of St. Thomas][7] has been running the Summit Events application (*under its former name UST Events*) in it's production org since September 6th, 2018. This running version is heavily integrated with their current admission application solution so diverges some in functionality from what you see in this repository. Part of the work to be done here is to bring back functionality that had to be cut and integrate the missing features with EDA and/or NPSP. All that being said, St. Thomas' running application has quite a bit of documentation (we're going to call it legacy documentation) that largely overlaps with this repository and could be helpful.
